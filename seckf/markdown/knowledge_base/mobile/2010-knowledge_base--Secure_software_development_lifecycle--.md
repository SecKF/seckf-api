## Description:

Secure software development lifecycle

MSTG-ARCH-10: Security is addressed within all parts of the software development lifecycle.

The Systems Development Lifecycle (SDLC) is often depicted as a 6 part cyclical process where every step builds on top of the previous ones. In a similar fashion, security can be embedded in a SDLC by building on top of previous steps with policies, controls, designs, implementations and tests making sure that the product only performs the functions it was designed to and nothing more.
SDLC steps:

	- Planning
	- Analysis
	- Design
	- Implementation
	- Testing & Integration
	- Maintenance

## Mitigation:

SDLC should be part of development cycle.

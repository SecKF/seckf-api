## Description:

Data encryption on the network

MSTG-NETWORK-1: Data is encrypted on the network using TLS. The secure channel is used consistently throughout the app.

MSTG-NETWORK-2: The TLS settings are in line with current best practices, or as close as possible if the mobile operating system does not support the recommended standards.

One of the core mobile app functions is sending/receiving data over untrusted networks like the Internet. If the data is not properly protected in transit, an attacker with access to any part of the network infrastructure (e.g., a Wi-Fi access point) may intercept, read, or modify it. This is why plaintext network protocols are rarely advisable.

The vast majority of apps rely on HTTP for communication with the backend. HTTPS wraps HTTP in an encrypted connection (the acronym HTTPS originally referred to HTTP over Secure Socket Layer (SSL); SSL is the deprecated predecessor of TLS). TLS allows authentication of the backend service and ensures confidentiality and integrity of the network data.


## Mitigation:

Ensuring proper TLS configuration on the server side is also important. The SSL protocol is deprecated and should no longer be used. 

Also TLS v1.0 and TLS v1.1 have [known vulnerabilities](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/the-end-is-nigh-browser-makers-ditch-support-for-aging-tls-1-0-1-1-protocols "Browser-makers ditch support for aging TLS 1.0, 1.1 protocols") and their usage is deprecated in all major browsers by 2020.

TLS v1.2 and TLS v1.3 are considered best practice for secure transmission of data.

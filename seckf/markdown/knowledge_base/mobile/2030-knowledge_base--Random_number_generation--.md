## Description:

Random number generation

MSTG-CRYPTO-6: All random values are generated using a sufficiently secure random number generator.

Standard pseudo-random number generators cannot withstand cryptographic attacks.

Insecure randomness errors occur when a function that can produce predictable values is used as a source of randomness in security-sensitive context.


## Mitigation:

To focus on random values used by application, following checks should be performed:

	- identify all instances where random values are used
	- verify if random number generators are not considered as being cryptographically secure
	- verify how random number generators were used
	- verify randomness of random values generated by application

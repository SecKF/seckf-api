## Description:

Stateless (Token-Based) authentication

MSTG-AUTH-3: If stateless token-based authentication is used, the server provides a token that has been signed using a secure algorithm.

With *stateless* authentication, all user-identifying information is stored in a client-side token. The token can be passed to any server or micro service, eliminating the need to maintain session state on the server. Stateless authentication is often factored out to an authorization server, which produces, signs, and optionally encrypts the token upon user login.

Web applications commonly use stateful authentication with a random session ID that is stored in a client-side cookie. Although mobile apps sometimes use stateful sessions in a similar fashion, stateless token-based approaches are becoming popular for a variety of reasons:

	- They improve scalability and performance by eliminating the need to store session state on the server.
	- Tokens enable developers to decouple authentication from the app. Tokens can be generated by an authentication server, and the authentication scheme can be changed seamlessly.


## Mitigation:

Token-based authentication is implemented by sending a signed token (verified by the server) with each HTTP request. The most commonly used token format is the JSON Web Token, defined in [RFC7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519 "RFC7519"). A JWT may encode the complete session state as a JSON object. Therefore, the server doesn't have to store any session data or authentication information.

Verify that the implementation adheres to JWT [best practices](https://stormpath.com/blog/jwt-the-right-way "JWT the right way"):

	- Verify that the HMAC is checked for all incoming requests containing a token;
	- Verify the location of the private signing key or HMAC secret key. The key should remain on the server and should never be shared with the client. It should be available for the issuer and verifier only.
	- Verify that no sensitive data, such as personal identifiable information, is embedded in the JWT. If, for some reason, the architecture requires transmission of such information in the token, make sure that payload encryption is being applied. 
	- Make sure that replay attacks are addressed with the `jti` (JWT ID) claim, which gives the JWT a unique identifier.
	- Verify that tokens are stored securely on the mobile phone, with, for example, KeyChain (iOS) or KeyStore (Android).

## Description:

Testing obfuscation

MSTG-RESILIENCE-9: Obfuscation is applied to programmatic defenses, which in turn impede de-obfuscation via dynamic analysis.

Obfuscation is the process of transforming code and data to make it more difficult to comprehend. It is an integral part of every software protection scheme. What's important to understand is that obfuscation isn't something that can be simply turned on or off. Programs can be made incomprehensible, in whole or in part, in many ways and to different degrees.


## Mitigation:

Attempt to decompile the bytecode, disassemble any included library files and try to understand it. When doing so, consider the following:

	- Obfuscation often carries a cost in runtime performance, therefore it might have been only applied to certain very specific parts of the code, typically those dealing with security and runtime protection.
	- Meaningful identifiers, such as class names, method names, and variable names, might have been discarded.
	- String resources and strings in binaries might have been encrypted.
	- Code and data related to the protected functionality might be encrypted, packed, or otherwise concealed.

The following techniques can be used to obfuscate an application:

	- Name obfuscation
	- Instruction substitution
	- Control flow flattening
	- Dead code injection
	- String encryption

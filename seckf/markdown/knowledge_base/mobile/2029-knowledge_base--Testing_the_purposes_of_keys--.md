## Description:

Testing the purposes of keys

MSTG-CRYPTO-5: The app doesnâ€™t re-use the same cryptographic key for multiple purposes.


## Mitigation:

To focus on verification of purpose and reusage of the same cryptographic keys, following checks should be performed:

	- identify all instances where cryptography is used
	- identify purpose why cryptography is used (to protect data in use, in transit or at rest)
	- identify type of cryptography 
	- verify if cryptography is used according to its purpose

Memory corruption bugs

MSTG-CODE-8: In unmanaged code, memory is allocated, freed and used securely.

Memory corruption bugs are a popular mainstay with hackers. This class of bug results from a programming error that causes the program to access an unintended memory location. Under the right conditions, attackers can capitalize on this behavior to hijack the execution flow of the vulnerable program and execute arbitrary code. This kind of vulnerability occurs in a number of ways:

	- Buffer overflows
	- Out-of-bounds-access
	- Dangling pointers
	- Use-after-free
	- Integer overflows
	- Format string vulnerabilities

The primary goal in exploiting memory corruption is usually to redirect program flow into a location where the attacker has placed assembled machine instructions referred to as *shellcode*. On iOS, the data execution prevention feature (as the name implies) prevents execution from memory defined as data segments. To bypass this protection, attackers leverage return-oriented programming (ROP). This process involves chaining together small, pre-existing code chunks ("gadgets") in the text segment where these gadgets may execute a function useful to the attacker or, call `mprotect` to change memory protection settings for the location where the attacker stored the *shellcode*.

Android apps are, for the most part, implemented in Java which is inherently safe from memory corruption issues by design. However, native apps utilizing JNI libraries are susceptible to this kind of bug.

Similarly, iOS apps can wrap C/C++ calls in Obj-C or Swift, making them susceptible to these kind of attacks.


## Mitigation:

Static code analysis of low-level code is a complex topic that could easily fill its own book. Automated tools such as [RATS](https://code.google.com/archive/p/rough-auditing-tool-for-security/downloads "RATS - Rough auditing tool for security") combined with limited manual inspection efforts are usually sufficient to identify low-hanging fruits. However, memory corruption conditions often stem from complex causes. For example, a use-after-free bug may actually be the result of an intricate, counter-intuitive race condition not immediately apparent. Bugs manifesting from deep instances of overlooked code deficiencies are generally discovered through dynamic analysis or by testers who invest time to gain a deep understanding of the program.
